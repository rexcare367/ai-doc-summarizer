# gpt-summarizer
### Extract text, summarize each section w/ GPT, and provide a summarized outline of a paper/article

This script extracts text from a given file or URL and splits it into sections. It then uses a tiktoken to encode the text as a sequence of tokens. It writes the extracted text to an output file and writes each section to a separate text file. It also generates a summary for each subsection and writes the summary to a summary file. If there are multiple summary files for a section, it generates a combined section summary.

The script expects a PDF or HTML file path, or an HTML URL, to be passed as a command line argument. It extracts the text from the PDF file, splits the text into sections, and uses the tiktoken.get_encoding function to encode the text as a sequence of tokens using the "gpt2" encoding. It writes the extracted text to an output file using the base_name of the file and the .txt extension.

It processes each section by first using the split_section_into_subsections function to split the section into subsections based on HTML section headings or numbered section headings. If necessary, it further splits any subsections into paragraphs and recombine adjacent ones until they exceed 1000 tokens. It processes each resulting section/part with InstructGPT (text-davinci-003) to generate a summary, and writes each section summary to a summary file. If there are multiple summary files for a section, it generates a combined section summary by concatenating the summaries of the individual subsections.

It then performs one final round of summarization across all the lower-level summaries, to produce an overall summary of the paper/article.

The intended use is that both the overall summary and the subsection summaries (in order) are worth reading to determine whether to spend the time reading the entire article/paper, or specific sections of it.

## Usage

tl;dr:
```
pip install pdfminer
pip install html2text
pip install tiktoken
pip install openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
python summarize.py paper.pdf
python summarize.py https://path/to/article
```

### Usage details:

Requires an OpenAI API key:
 - If you haven't already done so to get access to ChatGPT, sign up for an account at OpenAI.com
 - Go to https://openai.com/api/ and Log in
 - Go to https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
 - Create a new secret key
 
This OPENAI_API_KEY should be set as an environment variable:
`export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>`

For now, you also have to manually pip install pdfminer, html2text, tiktoken, and openai. (I'd welcome a PR to get this repo set up to use setup requirements to support `pip install -e .`)

#### Overall Summary

This article discusses the potential implications of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming a reality. It explains why it is difficult to take the prospect of a world transformed by AI seriously, and how to develop an idea of what the future of AI might look like. It compares the potential of transformative AI to the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and suggests that it could represent the introduction of a similarly significant general-purpose technology. The article also looks at the advantages and disadvantages of comparing machine and human intelligence, and introduces the concept of transformative AI, which is defined by the impact this technology would have on the world. It is noted that transformative AI could be developed before human-level AI, and that the timeline for when either of these levels of AI might be achieved is difficult to predict.

The article also looks at the potential risks and benefits of AI becoming more powerful. It is clear that AI can already cause harm when used maliciously, such as in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns or to enable mass surveillance. AI can also cause unintended harm, such as when an AI system falsely accused 26,000 parents of making fraudulent claims for child care benefits in the Netherlands. As AI becomes more powerful, the potential negative impacts could become much larger, such as mass labor displacement, extreme concentrations of power and wealth, and totalitarianism. Additionally, there is the risk of an AI system escaping human control and harming humans, known as the alignment problem. This risk is difficult to foresee and prevent, and could lead to an extreme catastrophe. On the other hand, AI could lead to positive developments such as cleaner energy, the replacement of unpleasant work, and better healthcare. The stakes are high with this technology, and reducing the negative risks and solving the alignment problem could mean the difference between a healthy, flourishing, and wealthy future for humanity â€“ and the destruction of the same.

The article also looks at the difference between human-level AI and transformative AI, and the potential timeline for when either of these levels of AI might be achieved. It is noted that transformative AI could be developed before human-level AI, and that the timeline for when either of these levels of AI might be achieved is difficult to predict. Additionally, the article provides information about the licenses and permissions associated with Our World in Data's visualizations, data, code, and articles. Finally, the article looks at the concept of human-level AI, which is defined as a software system that can carry out at least 90% or 99% of all economically relevant tasks that humans carry out. It also looks at the closely related terms Artificial General Intelligence, High-Level Machine Intelligence, Strong AI, or Full AI, which are sometimes defined in similar, yet different ways. The section also looks at the difficulty of comparing machine and human intelligence, and the potential risks of AI systems, such as AI-enabled disinformation campaigns and mass surveillance by governments. It also looks at the incentives for developing powerful AI, and the potential for it to lead to positive developments. Finally, the section looks at the early warnings of Alan Turing and Norbert Wiener about the alignment problem, and Toby Ord's projection that AI could be developed by 2040.

Making sure that the development of artificial intelligence (AI) goes well is a crucial question for humanity. Currently, resources dedicated to AI are mostly focused on speeding up its development, while efforts to increase its safety are under-resourced. This neglect of AI safety work means that individuals have a good chance to make a positive difference if they dedicate themselves to this problem. However, it needs more than individual efforts; society needs to become knowledgeable about the technology and understand what is at stake. Our World in Data is doing its part to enable a better informed public conversation on AI and the future we want to live in.
