*  No cases of severe hypoglycemia (defined as a low blood glucose level causing altered mental consciousness and in­

ability to assist in care) or diabetic ketoacidosis (defined as a blood glucose level of >250 mg per deciliter [>13.9 mmol 
per liter], an arterial pH of <7.3 or a venous pH of <15 mEq per liter, or moderate ketonuria or ketonemia leading to 
hospitalization) were reported in either group.

†  A nonserious adverse device effect was defined as any untoward medical occurrence related to the use of an investiga­

tional device.

‡  A serious adverse event was defined as an adverse event that was unrelated to the use of a device and that was life­

threatening, caused permanent impairment to a body structure or function, required hospitalization, or led to a medi­
cal or surgical intervention to curb serious sequelae. A serious adverse device effect was defined as a serious adverse 
event that was related to the use of an investigational device.

§  There were no serious adverse events or serious adverse device effects in the adult cohort.

that have been shown to reduce the incidence of 
hypoglycemia.21 The generalizability of our find-
ings  may  be  limited  by  the  enrollment  of  pa-
tients with a relatively low glycated hemoglobin 
level at baseline, by the underrepresentation of 
patients with reduced economic resources, and 
by  the  increased  familiarity  with  insulin-pump 
therapy and continuous glucose monitoring among 
the  patients  at  baseline.  However,  the  trial  pa-
tients were more diverse than those enrolled in 
previous  studies  that  had  been  biased  by  pa-
tients’ selection of open-source AID. The effect size 
is  partially  due  to  a  small  decline  in  the  per-

centage of time in the target range in the con-
trol group, which has not been observed in other 
studies.  Unscheduled  contacts  with  trial  staff 
members  by  telephone,  email,  or  text  message 
were not recorded. Measurement of glycated hemo-
globin was not centralized and was performed on 
a point-of-care basis. Patients in the two groups 
used  different  insulin  pumps,  although  other 
studies have compared AID with “usual care.”22,23 
In addition, a variety of insulin pumps were used 
in the control group, although the stable time in 
the  target  range  throughout  the  trial  suggests 
that this factor had a minimal effect.

 Insulin Delivery in Type 1 Diabetes

In children and adults with type 1 diabetes, 
the use of an open-source AID system resulted 
in a significantly higher percentage of time in the 
target  glucose  range  than  the  use  of  a  sensor-
augmented insulin pump at 24 weeks.
