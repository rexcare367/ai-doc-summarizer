This section discusses the concept of human-level AI, which is defined as a software system that can carry out at least 90% or 99% of all economically relevant tasks that humans carry out. It also looks at the closely related terms Artificial General Intelligence, High-Level Machine Intelligence, Strong AI, or Full AI, which are sometimes defined in similar, yet different ways. The section also looks at the difficulty of comparing machine and human intelligence, and the potential risks of AI systems, such as AI-enabled disinformation campaigns and mass surveillance by governments. It also looks at the incentives for developing powerful AI, and the potential for it to lead to positive developments. Finally, the section looks at the early warnings of Alan Turing and Norbert Wiener about the alignment problem, and Toby Ord's projection that AI could be developed by 2040.
