This section describes the trial design for a study on Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 Diabetes. The study included a 4-week run-in phase, during which patients became familiar with the trial devices functioning as sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy. Patients were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the AID group or the control group. The AID group used an open-source system, which was a modified version of AndroidAPS paired with a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump and Dexcom G6 CGM. The primary outcome was percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter between day 155 and day 168. Secondary outcomes included metrics for continuous glucose monitoring, glycated hemoglobin level, and performance of the AID system. Adverse events that were evaluated included adverse device effects, serious adverse events, and serious adverse device effects. At approximately 3 months into the trial, a battery problem in a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump was identified. Patients in the control group had the option of returning to their usual insulin pump, and those in the AID group used refurbished preproduction DANA-i insulin pumps. The study had 90% power with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis of no between-group difference in the time in range.
