# Artificial intelligence is transforming our world — it is on all of us to
make sure that it goes well

How AI gets built is currently decided by a small group of technologists. As
this technology is transforming our lives, it should be in all of our interest
to become informed and engaged.

[by Max Roser](/team)

December 15, 2022

Why should you care about the development of artificial intelligence?

Think about what the alternative would look like. If you and the wider public
do not get informed and engaged, then we leave it to a few entrepreneurs and
engineers to decide how this technology will transform our world.

That is the status quo. This small number of people at a few tech firms
directly working on artificial intelligence (AI) do understand how
extraordinarily powerful this technology is
[becoming](https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-AI). If the rest of
society does not become engaged, then it will be this small elite who decides
how this technology will change our lives.

To change this status quo, I want to answer three questions in this article:
Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by AI seriously?
How can we imagine such a world? And what is at stake as this technology
becomes more powerful?

#### Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by artificial
intelligence seriously?

In some way, it should be obvious how technology can fundamentally transform
the world. We just have to look at how much the world has already changed. If
you could invite a family of hunter-gatherers from 20,000 years ago on your
next flight, they would be pretty surprised. Technology has changed our world
already, so we should expect that it can happen again.

But while we have seen the world transform before, we have seen these
transformations play out over the course of generations. What is different now
is how very rapid these technological changes have become. In the past, the
technologies that our ancestors used in their childhood were still central to
their lives in their old age. This has not been the case anymore for recent
generations. Instead, it has [become
common](https://ourworldindata.org/technology-long-run) that technologies
unimaginable in one’s youth become ordinary in later life.

This is the first reason we might not take the prospect seriously: it is easy
to underestimate the speed at which technology can change the world.

The second reason why it is difficult to take the possibility of
transformative AI – potentially even AI as intelligent as humans – seriously
is that it is an idea that we first heard in the cinema. It is not surprising
that for many of us, the first reaction to a scenario in which machines have
human-like capabilities is the same as if you had asked us to take seriously a
future in which vampires, werewolves, or zombies roam the planet.1

But, it is plausible that it is both the stuff of sci-fi fantasy _and_ the
central invention that could arrive in our, or our children’s, lifetimes.

The third reason why it is difficult to take this prospect seriously is by
failing to see that powerful AI could lead to very large changes. This is also
understandable. It is difficult to form an idea of a future that is very
different from our own time. There are two concepts that I find helpful in
imagining a very different future with artificial intelligence. Let’s look at
both of them.

#### How to develop an idea of what the future of artificial intelligence
might look like?

When thinking about the future of artificial intelligence, I find it helpful
to consider two different concepts in particular: human-level AI, and
transformative AI.2 The first concept highlights the AI’s capabilities and
anchors them to a familiar benchmark, while transformative AI emphasizes the
impact that this technology would have on the world.

From where we are today, much of this may sound like science fiction. It is
therefore worth keeping in mind that the majority of surveyed AI experts
[believe](https://ourworldindata.org/ai-timelines) there is a real chance that
human-level artificial intelligence will be developed within the next decades,
and some believe that it will exist much sooner.

##### The advantages and disadvantages of comparing machine and human
intelligence

One way to think about human-level artificial intelligence is to contrast it
with the current state of AI technology. While today’s AI systems often have
capabilities similar to a particular, limited part of the human mind, a human-
level AI would be a machine that is capable of carrying out the same _range_
of intellectual tasks that we humans are capable of.3 It is a machine that
would be “able to learn to do anything that a human can do,” as Norvig and
Russell put it in their textbook on AI.4

Taken together, the range of abilities that characterize intelligence gives
humans the ability to solve problems and achieve a wide variety of goals. A
human-level AI would therefore be a system that could solve all those problems
that we humans can solve, and do the tasks that humans do today. Such a
machine, or collective of machines, would be able to do the work of a
translator, an accountant, an illustrator, a teacher, a therapist, a truck
driver, or the work of a trader on the world’s financial markets. Like us, it
would also be able to do research and science, and to develop new technologies
based on that.

The concept of human-level AI has some clear advantages. Using the familiarity
of our own intelligence as a reference provides us with some clear guidance on
how to imagine the capabilities of this technology.

However, it also has clear disadvantages. Anchoring the imagination of future
AI systems to the familiar reality of human intelligence carries the risk that
it obscures the very real differences between them.

Some of these differences are obvious. For example, AI systems will have the
immense memory of computer systems, against which our own capacity to store
information pales. Another obvious difference is the speed at which a machine
can absorb and process information. But information storage and processing
speed are not the only differences. The domains in which machines already
outperform humans is steadily increasing: in chess, after matching the level
of the best human players in the late 90s, AI systems
[reached](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/computer-chess-ability)
superhuman levels more than a decade ago. In other games like Go or complex
strategy games, this has happened more recently.5

These differences mean that an AI that is at least as good as humans in every
domain would overall be much more powerful than the human mind. Even the first
“human-level AI” would therefore be quite superhuman in many ways.6

Human intelligence is also a bad metaphor for machine intelligence in other
ways. The way we think is often very different from machines, and as a
consequence the output of thinking machines can be very alien to us.

Most perplexing and most concerning are the strange and unexpected ways in
which machine intelligence can fail. The AI-generated image of the horse below
provides an example: on the one hand, AIs can do what no human can do –
produce an image of anything, in any style (here photorealistic), in mere
seconds – but on the other hand it can fail in ways that no human would fail.7
No human would make the mistake of drawing a horse with five legs.8

Imagining a powerful future AI as just another human would therefore likely be
a mistake. The differences might be so large that it will be a misnomer to
call such systems “human-level.”

##### Transformative artificial intelligence is defined by the impact this
technology would have on the world

In contrast, the concept of transformative AI is not based on a comparison
with human intelligence. This has the advantage of sidestepping the problems
that the comparisons with our own mind bring. But it has the disadvantage that
it is harder to imagine what such a system would look like and be capable of.
It requires more from us. It requires us to imagine a world with intelligent
actors that are potentially very different from ourselves.

Transformative AI is not defined by any specific capabilities, but by the
real-world impact that the AI would have. To qualify as transformative,
researchers think of it as AI that is “powerful enough to bring us into a new,
qualitatively different future.”10

In humanity’s history, there have been two cases of such major
transformations, the agricultural and the industrial revolutions.

Transformative AI becoming a reality would be an event on that scale. Like the
arrival of agriculture 10,000 years ago, or the transition from hand- to
machine-manufacturing, it would be an event that would change the world for
billions of people around the globe and for the entire trajectory of
[humanity’s future](https://ourworldindata.org/longtermism).

Technologies that fundamentally change how a wide range of goods or services
are produced are called ‘general-purpose technologies’. The two previous
transformative events were caused by the discovery of two particularly
significant general-purpose technologies: the change in food production as
humanity transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming, and the rise of
machine manufacturing in the industrial revolution. Based on the evidence and
arguments presented in [this series](https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-
intelligence#research-writing) on AI development, I believe it is plausible
that powerful AI could represent the introduction of a similarly significant
general-purpose technology.

**Timeline of the three transformative events in world history**

![Timeline of transformative
events](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2022/12/Timeline-of-Transformative-
Events.png)

##### A future of human-level or transformative AI?

The two concepts are closely related, but they are not the same. The creation
of a human-level AI would certainly have a transformative impact on our world.
If the work of most humans could be carried out by an AI, the lives of
millions of people would change.11

The opposite, however, is not true: we might see transformative AI without
developing human-level AI. Since the human mind is in many ways a poor
metaphor for the intelligence of machines, we might plausibly develop
transformative AI before we develop human-level AI. Depending on how this
goes, this might mean that we will never see any machine intelligence for
which human intelligence is a helpful comparison.

When and if AI systems might reach either of these levels is of course
difficult to predict. In my [companion article](https://ourworldindata.org/ai-
timelines) on this question, I give an overview of what researchers in this
field currently believe. Many AI experts believe there is a real chance that
such systems will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that
they will exist much sooner.

#### What is at stake as artificial intelligence becomes more powerful?

All major technological innovations lead to a range of positive and negative
consequences. For AI, the spectrum of possible outcomes – from the most
negative to the most positive – is extraordinarily wide.

That the use of AI technology can cause harm is clear, because it is already
happening.

AI systems can cause harm when people use them maliciously. For example, when
they are used in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns or to enable
mass surveillance.12

But AI systems can also cause unintended harm, when they act differently than
intended or fail. For example, in the Netherlands the authorities used an AI
system which falsely claimed that an estimated 26,000 parents made fraudulent
claims for child care benefits. The false allegations led to hardship for many
poor families, and also resulted in the resignation of the Dutch government in
2021.13

As AI becomes more powerful, the possible negative impacts could become much
larger. Many of these risks have rightfully received public attention: more
powerful AI could lead to mass labor displacement, or extreme concentrations
of power and wealth. In the hands of autocrats, it could empower
totalitarianism through its suitability for mass surveillance and control.

The so-called _alignment problem_ of AI is another extreme risk. This is the
concern that _nobody_ would be able to control a powerful AI system, even if
the AI takes actions that harm us humans, or humanity as a whole. This risk is
unfortunately receiving little attention from the wider public, but it is seen
as an extremely large risk by many leading AI researchers.14

How could an AI possibly escape human control and end up harming humans?

The risk is not that an AI becomes self-aware, develops bad intentions, and
“chooses” to do this. The risk is that we try to instruct the AI to pursue
some specific goal – even a very worthwhile one – and in the pursuit of that
goal it ends up harming humans. It is about unintended consequences. The AI
does what we told it to do, but not what we wanted it to do.

Can’t we just tell the AI to not do those things? It is definitely possible to
build an AI that avoids any particular problem we foresee, but it is hard to
foresee _all_ the possible harmful unintended consequences. The alignment
problem arises because of “the impossibility of defining true human purposes
correctly and completely,” as AI researcher Stuart Russell puts it.15

Can’t we then just switch off the AI? This might also not be possible. That is
because a powerful AI would know two things: it faces a risk that humans could
turn it off, and it can’t achieve its goals once it has been turned off. As a
consequence, the AI will pursue a very fundamental goal of ensuring that it
won’t be switched off. This is why, once we realize that an extremely
intelligent AI is causing unintended harm in the pursuit of some specific
goal, it might not be possible to turn it off or change what the system
does.16

This risk – that humanity might not be able to stay in control once AI becomes
very powerful, and that this might lead to an extreme catastrophe – has been
recognized right from the early days of AI research more than 70 years ago.17
The very rapid development of AI in recent years has made a solution to this
problem much more urgent.

I have tried to summarize some of the risks of AI, but a short article is not
enough space to address all possible questions. Especially on the very worst
risks of AI systems, and what we can do now to reduce them, I recommend
reading the book [The Alignment Problem](https://brianchristian.org/the-
alignment-problem/) by Brian Christian and Benjamin Hilton’s article
[‘Preventing an AI-related catastrophe’](https://80000hours.org/problem-
profiles/artificial-intelligence).

If we manage to avoid these risks, transformative AI could also lead to very
positive consequences. Advances in science and technology were crucial to [the
many positive developments](https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-
living-conditions-in-5-charts) in humanity’s history. If artificial ingenuity
can augment our own, it could help us make progress on the many large problems
we face: from cleaner energy, to the replacement of unpleasant work, to much
better healthcare.

This extremely large contrast between the possible positives and negatives
makes clear that the stakes are unusually high with this technology. Reducing
the negative risks and solving the alignment problem could mean the difference
between a healthy, flourishing, and wealthy future for humanity – and the
destruction of the same.

#### How can we make sure that the development of AI goes well?

Making sure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well is not
just one of the most crucial questions of our time, but likely one of the most
crucial questions in human history. This needs public resources – public
funding, public attention, and public engagement.

Currently, almost all resources that are dedicated to AI aim to speed up the
development of this technology. Efforts that aim to increase the safety of AI
systems, on the other hand, do not receive the resources they need. Researcher
Toby Ord estimated that in 2020 between $10 to $50 million was spent on work
to address the alignment problem.18 Corporate AI investment in the same year
was more than 2000-times larger, it [summed
up](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/corporate-investment-in-artificial-
intelligence-total?country=~OWID_WRL) to $125 billion.

This is not only the case for the AI alignment problem. The work on the entire
range of negative social consequences from AI is under-resourced compared to
the large investments to increase the power and use of AI systems.

It is frustrating and concerning for society as a whole that AI safety work is
extremely neglected and that little public funding is dedicated to this
crucial field of research. On the other hand, for each _individual_ person
this neglect means that they have a good chance to actually make a positive
difference, if they dedicate themselves to this problem now. And while the
field of AI safety is small, it does provide [good
resources](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-
intelligence/#what-can-you-do-concretely-to-help) on what you can do
concretely if you want to work on this problem.

I hope that more people dedicate their individual careers to this cause, but
it needs more than individual efforts. A technology that is transforming our
society needs to be a central interest of all of us. As a society we have to
think more about the societal impact of AI, become knowledgeable about the
technology, and understand what is at stake.

When our children look back at today, I imagine that they will find it
difficult to understand how little attention and resources we dedicated to the
development of safe AI. I hope that this changes in the coming years, and that
we begin to dedicate more resources to making sure that powerful AI gets
developed in a way that benefits us and the next generations.

If we fail to develop this broad-based understanding, then it will remain the
small elite that finances and builds this technology that will determine how
one of the – or plausibly _the_ – most powerful technology in human history
will transform our world.

### Endnotes

  1. This problem becomes even larger when we try to imagine how a future with a human-level AI might play out. Any _particular_ scenario will not only involve the idea that this powerful AI exists, but a whole range of additional assumptions about the future context in which this happens. It is therefore hard to communicate a scenario of a world with human-level AI that does not sound contrived, bizarre or even silly.

  2. Both of these concepts are widely used in the scientific literature on artificial intelligence. For example, questions about the timelines for the development of future AI are often framed using these terms. See [my article on this topic](https://ourworldindata.org/ai-timelines).

  3. The fact that humans are capable of a _range_ of intellectual tasks means that you arrive at different definitions of intelligence depending on which aspect within that range you focus on (the [Wikipedia entry on intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence), for example, lists a number of definitions from various researchers and different disciplines). As a consequence there are also various definitions of ‘human-level AI’. 

There are also several closely related terms: Artificial General Intelligence,
High-Level Machine Intelligence, Strong AI, or Full AI are sometimes
synonymously used, and sometimes defined in similar, yet different ways. In
specific discussions, it is necessary to define this concept more narrowly;
for example, in [studies on AI timelines](https://ourworldindata.org/ai-
timelines) researchers offer more precise definitions of what human-level AI
refers to in their particular study.

  5. The AI system [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), and its various successors, won against Go masters. The AI system [Pluribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_\(poker_bot\)) beat humans at no-limit Texas hold ’em poker. The AI system Cicero can strategize and use human language to win the strategy game Diplomacy. See: Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team (FAIR), Anton Bakhtin, Noam Brown, Emily Dinan, Gabriele Farina, Colin Flaherty, Daniel Fried, et al. (2022) – ‘Human-Level Play in the Game of Diplomacy by Combining Language Models with Strategic Reasoning’.

  6. This also poses a problem when we evaluate how the intelligence of a machine compares with the intelligence of humans. If intelligence was a general ability, a single capacity, then we could easily compare and evaluate it, but the fact that it is a range of skills makes it much more difficult to compare across machine and human intelligence. Tests for AI systems are therefore comprising a wide range of tasks. See for example Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt (2020) – [Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) or the definition of what would qualify as artificial general intelligence in [this Metaculus prediction](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/).

  7. An overview of how AI systems can fail can be found in [Charles Choi – 7 Revealing Ways AIs Fail](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-failures). It is also worth reading through the [AIAAIC Repository](https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/ai-and-algorithmic-incidents-and-controversies) which “details recent incidents and controversies driven by or relating to AI, algorithms, and automation.”

  8. I have taken this example from [AI researcher François Chollet](https://fchollet.com/), who published it [here](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1573752180720312320?s=46&t=qPwLwDgLdJrLlXxa878BDQ).

  10. This quote is from Holden Karnofsky (2021) – [AI Timelines: Where the Arguments, and the “Experts,” Stand](https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/). For Holden Karnofsky’s earlier thinking on this conceptualization of AI see his 2016 article [‘Some Background on Our Views Regarding Advanced Artificial Intelligence’](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/some-background-on-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence/#Sec1).

Ajeya Cotra, whose research on AI timelines I discuss in other articles of
this series, attempts to give a quantitative definition of what would qualify
as transformative AI. in her widely cited [report on AI
timelines](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-
report-on-ai-timelines) she defines it as a change in software technology that
brings the growth rate of gross world product “to 20%-30% per year”. Several
other researchers define TAI in similar terms.

  11. Human-level AI is typically defined as a software system that can carry out at least 90% or 99% of all economically relevant tasks that humans carry out. A lower-bar definition would be an AI system that can carry out all those tasks that can currently be done by another human who is working remotely on a computer.

  12. On the use of AI in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns see for example John Villasenor (November 2020) – [How to deal with AI-enabled disinformation](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907044354/https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-deal-with-ai-enabled-disinformation/). More generally on this topic see Brundage and Avin et al. (2018) – The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation, published at [maliciousaireport.com](https://maliciousaireport.com/). A starting point for literature and reporting on mass surveillance by governments is [the relevant Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects).

  13. See for example the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal) on the ‘Dutch childcare benefits scandal’ and Melissa Heikkilä (2022) – [‘Dutch scandal serves as a warning for Europe over risks of using algorithms’](https://web.archive.org/web/20221117053636/https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-scandal-serves-as-a-warning-for-europe-over-risks-of-using-algorithms/), in Politico. The technology can also reinforce discrimination in terms of race and gender. See Brian Christian’s book The Alignment Problem and the [reports of the AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/reports.html).

  14. Overviews are provided in Stuart Russell (2019) – Human Compatible (especially chapter 5) and Brian Christian’s 2020 book [The Alignment Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alignment_Problem). Christian presents the thinking of many leading AI researchers from the earliest days up to now and presents an excellent overview of this problem. It is also seen as a large risk by some of the leading private firms who work towards powerful AI – see OpenAI’s article “[Our approach to alignment research](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/)” from August 2022.

  15. Stuart Russell (2019) – Human Compatible

  16. A question that follows from this is, why build such a powerful AI in the first place? 

The incentives are very high. As I emphasize below, this innovation has the
potential to lead to very positive developments. In addition to the large
social benefits there are also large incentives for those who develop it – the
governments that can use it for their goals, the individuals who can use it to
become more powerful and wealthy. Additionally, it is of scientific interest
and might help us to understand our own mind and intelligence better. And
lastly, even if we wanted to stop building powerful AIs, it is likely very
hard to actually achieve it. It is very hard to coordinate across the whole
world and agree to stop building more advanced AI – countries around the world
would have to agree and then find ways to actually implement it.

  17. In 1950 the computer science pioneer Alan Turing put it like this: _“If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we do, and then where should we be? … [T]his new danger is much closer. If it comes at all it will almost certainly be within the next millennium. It is remote but not astronomically remote, and is certainly something which can give us anxiety. It is customary, in a talk or article on this subject, to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some particularly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. … I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.”_ Alan. M. Turing (1950) – [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433), In Mind, Volume LIX, Issue 236, October 1950, Pages 433–460.

Norbert Wiener is another pioneer who saw the alignment problem very early.
One way he put it was “If we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency
with whose operation we cannot interfere effectively … we had better be quite
sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really
desire.” quoted from Norbert Wiener (1960) – Some Moral and Technical
Consequences of Automation: As machines learn they may develop unforeseen
strategies at rates that baffle their programmers. In Science.

In 1950 – the same year in which Turing published the cited article – Wiener
published his book The Human Use of Human Beings, whose front-cover blurb
reads: “The ‘mechanical brain’ and similar machines can destroy human values
or enable us to realize them as never before.”
