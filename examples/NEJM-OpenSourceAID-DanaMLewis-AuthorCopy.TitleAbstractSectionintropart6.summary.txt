This section provides a comparison of the characteristics of patients in the Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) group and the control group in the CREATE trial. The characteristics include the quintile of the New Zealand Deprivation Index, diabetes history, glycated hemoglobin, previous use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery, and time in target glucose range. The AID group had a mean percent glycated hemoglobin of 7.6 mmol/mol, 15 patients (65%) had previously used CGM, and 4 patients (17%) had previously used automated insulin delivery. The control group had a mean percent glycated hemoglobin of 7.8 mmol/mol, 17 patients (65%) had previously used CGM, and 5 patients (19%) had previously used automated insulin delivery. The time in target glucose range was 64.7±12.9% for the AID group and 60.3±15.6% for the control group. The section also provides information on device deficiencies, which were more common in the AID group (46 events) than in the control group (39 events).
