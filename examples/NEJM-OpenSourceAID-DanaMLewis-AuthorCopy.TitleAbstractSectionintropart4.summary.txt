This section describes the data capture and management processes, data cleaning and analyses, and primary and secondary outcomes of a clinical trial that tested the efficacy of an automated insulin delivery (AID) system in patients with type 1 diabetes. A total of 100 patients were enrolled, 97 of whom (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization to either the AID group (44 patients) or the control group (53 patients). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two trial groups. The final patient completed the trial in November 2021. In the primary analysis, the mean time in range increased from 61.2% at baseline to 71.2% in the AID group and decreased from 57.7% to 54.5% in the control group. Among the children, the mean time in range increased from 57.4% at baseline to 67.5% in the AID group and decreased from 55.1% to 52.5% in the control group. During a 24-hour period, the percentage of time that patients had a glucose reading of less than 70 mg per deciliter was 2.1% in the AID group and 2.7% in the control group. The use of AID was most effective at night, when the mean time in range was 76.8% in the AID group and 57.2% in the control group. Among the adults, the mean time in range increased from 64.7% at baseline to 74.5% in the AID group and decreased from 61.2% to 58.2% in the control group.
