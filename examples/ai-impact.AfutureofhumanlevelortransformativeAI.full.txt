##### A future of human-level or transformative AI?
The two concepts are closely related, but they are not the same. The creation
of a human-level AI would certainly have a transformative impact on our world.
If the work of most humans could be carried out by an AI, the lives of
millions of people would change.11

The opposite, however, is not true: we might see transformative AI without
developing human-level AI. Since the human mind is in many ways a poor
metaphor for the intelligence of machines, we might plausibly develop
transformative AI before we develop human-level AI. Depending on how this
goes, this might mean that we will never see any machine intelligence for
which human intelligence is a helpful comparison.

When and if AI systems might reach either of these levels is of course
difficult to predict. In my [companion article](https://ourworldindata.org/ai-
timelines) on this question, I give an overview of what researchers in this
field currently believe. Many AI experts believe there is a real chance that
such systems will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that
they will exist much sooner.
