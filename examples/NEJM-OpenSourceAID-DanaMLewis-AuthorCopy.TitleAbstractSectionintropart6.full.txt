 Plus–minus values areSD. Children were defined as patients under the age of 16 years. A full list of patient 
characteristics at baseline is shown in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. IQR denotes interquartile range.
 The patients (or their parents or guardians) could select more than one ethnic group. However, they were assigned 
to a single ethnic group for statistical evaluation with the list prioritized in the order of Maori; Pacific Islander; Asian; 
Middle Eastern, Latin American, or African; and European or other. No patients selected the Pacific Islander category, 
and no children selected the Middle Eastern, Latin American, or African category.
 The New Zealand Deprivation Index is an area­based measure of socioeconomic deprivation in which the fifth quintile 
represents the 20% most deprived areas in the country.
 Glycated hemoglobin was measured with the use of the DCA Vantage Analyzer.
 Previous use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was defined as use of a CGM system more than 75% of the 
time before the baseline visit.
 Automated insulin delivery refers to a hybrid closed­loop system.

**   The time in the target glucose range is the percentage of time that the patient had a glucose level of 70 to 180 mg per 

deciliter (3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter) during the run­in period.

deficiencies are shown in Table S10. Fewer de-
vice  deficiencies  were  reported  during  the  ran-
domized trial than during the run-in period (0.8 
per 100 user-days vs. 5.1 per 100 user-days). This 
difference reflects action taken to address
battery problem that has been described previ-
ously.

Most device deficiencies were related to hard-
ware (46 in the AID group and 39 in the control 
group) followed by connectivity issues (20 in the 
AID group and 7 in the control group); one de-
vice deficiency was attributed to the application 
display.  The  insulin  pump  produced  the  most 
device  deficiencies  (47  events  affecting  34  pa-
tients), followed by the pump Auto Setter device 
(16 events).

Discussion

In  the  CREATE  trial,  we  found  that 
who the open-source AID system had 
3  hours  21  minutes  more  time  in  the  target 
glucose range per day than those who were us-
ing sensor-augmentedpump therapy, a 
between-group  difference  of  14  percentage 
points. Patients in the AID group had improved 

glycemic  control  while  maintaining  a  low
