12.5% and an absolute treatment effect of 10%.13 
The sample size was increased to 50 adults and 
50 children to allow for a differential treatment 
effect according to age, improved safety assess-
ment, and potential loss to follow-up.

Data  capture  and  management  processes 
have  been  described  previously.8  Data  cleaning 
and analyses were performed with the use of 
R  software,  version  4.1.1.  Data  regarding  con-
tinuous glucose monitoring were extracted from 
Nightscout  and  glucose  metrics  calculated  for 
sequential  14-day  periods,  starting  14  days  be-
fore the trial period began and finishing at day 
168.  Data  were  aggregated  according  to  trial 
group and time of day.

The  primary  outcome  was  fitted  to  a  linear 
regression model with independent variables in-
cluding  stratification  variables,  dependent  vari-
ables measured at baseline, trial group, and age 
according  to  group  interaction.  We  compared 
this model sequentially with simpler models (in 
which the trial group or the interaction accord-
ing to age was excluded) using analysis of vari-
ance to calculate two-sided P values for an overall 
treatment effect and differential treatment effect 
according  to  age.  Between-group  differences 
were  estimated  with  95%  confidence  intervals. 
Secondary  outcomes  regarding  continuous  glu-
cose monitoring and glycated hemoglobin were 
handled  similarly  without  hypothesis  testing. 
The widths of the confidence intervals were not 
adjusted for multiplicity and may not be used in 
place of hypothesis testing. Linear mixed-effects 
regression models that incorporated all available 
data were used to confirm the robustness of the 
results (Table S4).

Patients and Follow-up
A total of 100 patients were enrolled from Sep-
tember 2020 through May 2021. Three patients 
withdrew during the run-in period, and 97 pa-
tients  (48  children  and  49  adults)  underwent 
randomization to either the AID group (44 pa-
tients)  or  the  control  group  (53  patients).  Un-
balanced  group  size  was  exacerbated  by  the 
number  of  strata  (16)  that  were  used  during 
randomization.8

The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were  similar  in  the  two  trial  groups  (Tables  1 

and S5). Children were more likely than adults 
to  have  used  continuous  glucose  monitoring; 
previous  use  of  AID  systems  was  uncommon. 
Table  S6  shows  the  representativeness  of  the 
patients  among  the  population  of  those  with 
type 1 diabetes.

The final patient completed the trial in Novem-
ber 2021. in the AID group (1 child 
and 1 adult) withdrew from the trial because of 
frustration with the trial devices; all 53 patients 
in  the  control  group  completed  the  trial  (Fig. 
S2).  During  days  155  to  168,  the  median  per-
centage of expected readings that were recorded 
by continuous glucose monitoring was 97% (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 95 to 99) in the AID group 
and 95% (IQR, 89 to 98) in the control group. 
Eight patients (2 in the AID group and 6 in the 
control  group)  provided  less  than  70%  of  ex-
pected glucose readings.

Efficacy Outcomes
All Patients
In the primary analysis, the mean (±SD) time in 
the  target  range  increased  from  61.2±12.3%  at 
baseline  to  71.2±12.1%  in  the  AID  group  and 
decreased from 57.7±14.3% to 54.5±16.0% in the 
control  group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  14.0 
percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
9.2 to 18.8; P<0.001); the between-group differ-
ence per day was 3 hours 21 minutes. The per-
centage of patients who had a time in range of 
more than 70% and a time below range (<70 mg 
per deciliter) of less than 4% was 52.0% in the 
AID group and 11.0% in the control group (ad-
justed  difference,  36.9  percentage  points;  95% 
CI, 25.9 to 48.5). No treatment effect according 
to  interaction  by  age  was  detected  (P = 0.56). 
Primary  and  secondary  efficacy  glycemic  out-
comes are provided separately for children and 
adults  (Tables  2  and  S7).  Additional  subgroup 
analyses of the percentage of time in the target 
range are provided in Table S8.

Children
Among the children, the mean time in range 
increased  from  57.4±10.6%  at  baseline  to 
67.5±11.5%  in  the  AID  group  and  decreased 
from  55.1±12.6%  to  52.5±17.5%  in  the  control 
group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  12.6  percent-
age  points;  95%  CI,  5.7  to  19);  the  between-
group difference per day was 3 hours 1 minute.

range of more than 70% and a time below range 
of less than 4% was 40% in the AID group and 
7%  in  the  control  group  (adjusted  difference, 
32.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 16.2 to 49.7). The 
intervention effect was apparent within 2 weeks 
after the initiation of AID and was maintained 
during the 24-week trial period (Fig. 1).

During  a  24-hour  period,  the  percentage  of 
time that patients had a glucose reading of less 
than 70 mg per deciliter was 2.1% (30 minutes) 
in the AID group and 2.7% (39 minutes) in the 
control  group.  The  percentage  of  time  that 
patients  had  a  glucose  reading  of  more  than 
180 mg per deciliter was 39.1% (9 hours 24 min-
utes) in the AID group and 44.8% (10 hours 48 
minutes) in the control group.

The  use  of  AID  was  most  effective  at  night 
(Figs. 2 and S3), when the mean time in range 
was 76.8±15.8%, as compared with 64.3±11.7% 
during the day. In the control group, the mean 
time  in  range  was  57.2±21.4%  at  night  and 
50.9±17.4% during the day. Overnight, the per-
centage of time that patients had a time in range 
of less than 70 mg per deciliter was 1.2% in the 
AID group and 3.1% in the control group. At the 
end of the trial, the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 7.0% (52.6 mmol per mole) in the AID 
group  and  7.6%  (59.2  mmol  per  mole)  in  the 
control group.

Adults
Among  the  adults,  the  mean  time  in  range 
increased  from  64.7±12.9%  at  baseline  to 
74.5±11.9%  in  AID  group  and
