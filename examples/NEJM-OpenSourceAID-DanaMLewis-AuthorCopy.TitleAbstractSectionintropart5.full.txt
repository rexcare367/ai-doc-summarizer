Title-Abstract. Section intro

from  60.3±15.6%  to  56.5±14.2%  in  the  control 
group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  15.4  percent-
age  points;  95%  CI,  8.6  to  22.1);  the  between-
group  difference  per  day  was  3  hours  41  min-
utes. The mean percentage of patients who had 
a time in range of more than 70% and a time 
below range of less than 4% was 64% in the AID 
group  and  15%  in  the  control  group  (adjusted 
difference, 41.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 27.0 
to 57.5).

During a 24-hour period, the mean percent-
age of time that the glucose value was less than 
70 mg per deciliter was 1.6% (23 minutes) in the 
AID group and 1.8% (26 minutes) in the control 
group. The percentage of time that the glucose 
value  was  more  than  180  mg  per  deciliter  was 
23.9%  (5  hours  42  minutes)  in  the  AID  group 
and 41.6% (10.0 hours) in the control group. As 

with  the  children,  the  use  AID  was  most 
effective in the adults at night, when the time 
in  range  was  85.2±12.7%,  as  compared  with 
70.9±12.7% during the day. In the control group, 
the  mean  time  in  range  at  night  (53.5±20.1%) 
was similar to that during the day (57.5±14.4%) 
(Figs. 2 and S3). Overnight, the percentage of 
time that the glucose level was less than 70 mg 
per  deciliter  was  2.2%  in  the  AID  group  and 
1.9%  in  the  control  group.  In  both  adults  and 
children, the increases in the percentage of time 
in range was attributed mainly to overnight im-
provement with the AID system (Fig. S4). At the 
end of the trial, the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 6.8% (50.7 mmol per mole) in the AID 
group  and  7.5%  (58.5  mmol  per  mole)  in  the 
control group.

Safety Outcomes
Neither severe hypoglycemia nor diabetic keto-
acidosis  occurred  in  either  trial  group,  and  no 
adverse events were related to the algorithm or 
automation of insulin delivery. Prespecified ad-
verse events are provided in Table 3.

Ten adverse events that were related to a de-
vice (nonserious adverse device effects) were re-
ported among 8 patients in the AID group, and 
8 events were reported among 8 patients in the 
control group. These events included 6 hypergly-
cemia  events  in  the  AID  group  and  5  in  the 
control group and were mainly due to infusion-
set  failures.  One  adult  in  the  AID  group  had 
superficial  skin  burns  on  separate  occasions 
from two different preproduction DANA-i insu- pumps.

Two  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  the 
AID  group  (hospitalizations  for  hyperglycemia 
in one child due to infusion-set failure and the 
other  unrelated  to  diabetes),  and  5  serious  ad-
verse  events  (all  in  children)  occurred  in  the 
control group: 1 hyperglycemia event owing to 
insulin-pump failure and 4 events unrelated to 
diabetes. The rate of severe hyperglycemia and 
ketosis  (capillary  glucose  level,  >300  mg  per 
deciliter; ketones, >1.5 mmol per liter and symp-
tomatic) per 100 user-days was 0.10 in the AID 
group and 0.07 in the control group.

System Performance
In the AID group, the median percentage of time 
that the system was automating insulin delivery 
was 94.2% (IQR, 87.3 to 95.7) (Table S9). Device
