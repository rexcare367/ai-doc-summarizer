This section provides information on the safety outcomes and system performance of a trial that tested the use of an automated insulin delivery (AID) system in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. The AID system was found to be most effective at night, when the time in range was 85.2±12.7% in the AID group, compared to 70.9±12.7% during the day. In the control group, the mean time in range at night (53.5±20.1%) was similar to that during the day (57.5±14.4%). Neither severe hypoglycemia nor diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in either trial group, and no adverse events were related to the algorithm or automation of insulin delivery. Ten adverse events that were related to a device (nonserious adverse device effects) were reported among 8 patients in the AID group, and 8 events were reported among 8 patients in the control group. Two serious adverse events occurred in the AID group, and 5 serious adverse events occurred in the control group. The median percentage of time that the system was automating insulin delivery was 94.2% (IQR, 87.3 to 95.7) in the AID group.
