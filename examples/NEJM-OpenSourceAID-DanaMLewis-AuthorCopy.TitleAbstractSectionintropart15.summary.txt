This section provides information about the limitations of the trial and the generalizability of the findings. It was noted that the control group did not have an automated system for predicting low-glucose levels or suspending insulin administration, which have been shown to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia. The trial patients were more diverse than those enrolled in previous studies, but the generalizability of the findings may be limited by the enrollment of patients with a relatively low glycated hemoglobin level at baseline, by the underrepresentation of patients with reduced economic resources, and by the increased familiarity with insulin-pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring among the patients at baseline. In addition, a variety of insulin pumps were used in the control group, although the stable time in the target range throughout the trial suggests that this factor had a minimal effect. The section also provides information about the study's funding and disclosure forms.
