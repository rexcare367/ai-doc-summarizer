Title-Abstract. Section intro

centage of time during which the glucose level 
was less than 70 mg per deciliter. The improved 
glycemic  control  during  AID  therapy  is  consis-
tent  with  findings  in  observational  studies,14,15 
which  are  limited  by  a  self-selected  cohort  of 
patients who have chosen to use an open-source 
AID system. The positive effect of AID therapy 
on glycemia in our trial was greatest overnight, 
a finding that was consistent with the results of 
evaluations of commercial AID systems.16 In the 
AID  group,  adults  had  a  higher  percentage  of 
time in the target range than children,13,17 pos-
sibly because of differences in glycemic variabil-
ity,18 likelihood of administration of an insulin 
bolus  before  a  meal,  activity  level,  and  dietary 
factors. Even so, children still had the greatest 
improvement  in  the  percentage  of  time  in  the 
target range between baseline and the end of the 
trial.  Other  studies  have  also  shown  that  pa-
tients with the lowest baseline time in the target 
range gain the most from the use of AID.16,19

The absolute differences in the percentage of 
time in range between the trial groups are simi-
lar  to  between-group  differences  for  commer-
cially available AID systems.13,16,17 Such between-
