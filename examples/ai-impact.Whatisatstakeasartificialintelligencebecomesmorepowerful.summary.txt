This section discusses the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming more powerful. It is clear that AI can already cause harm when used maliciously, such as in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns or to enable mass surveillance. AI can also cause unintended harm, such as when an AI system falsely accused 26,000 parents of making fraudulent claims for child care benefits in the Netherlands. As AI becomes more powerful, the potential negative impacts could become much larger, such as mass labor displacement, extreme concentrations of power and wealth, and totalitarianism. Additionally, there is the risk of an AI system escaping human control and harming humans, known as the alignment problem. This risk is difficult to foresee and prevent, and could lead to an extreme catastrophe. On the other hand, AI could lead to positive developments such as cleaner energy, the replacement of unpleasant work, and better healthcare. The stakes are high with this technology, and reducing the negative risks and solving the alignment problem could mean the difference between a healthy, flourishing, and wealthy future for humanity â€“ and the destruction of the same.
