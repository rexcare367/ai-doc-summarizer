This section discusses the potential implications of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming a reality. It explains why it is difficult to take the prospect of a world transformed by AI seriously, and how to develop an idea of what the future of AI might look like. It also looks at the advantages and disadvantages of comparing machine and human intelligence, and introduces the concept of transformative AI, which is defined by the impact this technology would have on the world. It compares the potential of transformative AI to the agricultural and industrial revolutions, and suggests that it could represent the introduction of a similarly significant general-purpose technology.
