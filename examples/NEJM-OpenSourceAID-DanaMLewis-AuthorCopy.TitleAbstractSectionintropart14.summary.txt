This section describes the results of a trial comparing the use of open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) and sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy (control group) in children (7 to 15 years of age) and adults (16 to 70 years of age). The results are presented in two figures, which show the percentage of time that patients were in the target glucose range (70 to 180 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter]) during contiguous 4-week periods from 4 weeks before randomization to 24 weeks after randomization. The results indicate that the AID group had a higher percentage of time in the target glucose range than the control group, and that the group differences are partly attributable to a decrease in the percentage of time in range in the control group after the run-in period. The trial also had a high level of patient retention, a lack of remote monitoring, and broad inclusion criteria, which resulted in a population of diverse ages and ethnic backgrounds.
