abs tr actBACKGROUND
Open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are used by many patients 
with type 1 diabetes. Data are needed on the efficacy and safety of an open-source 
AID system.

METHODS
In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients 
with type 1 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-
augmented insulin pump (control). The both children (defined 
as 7 to 15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16 to 70 years of age). The AID 
system was a modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 
algorithm)  paired  with  a  preproduction  DANA-i  insulin  pump  and  Dexcom  G6 
CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface. The 
primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70 to 
180 mg per deciliter (3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter) between days 155 and 168 (the 
final 2 weeks of the trial).

RESULTS
A total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization (44 to 
open-source AID and 53 to the control group). At 24 weeks, the mean (±SD) time 
in the target range increased from 61.2±12% to 71.2±12.1% AID group 
and decreased from 57.7±14.3% to 54.5±16.0% in the control group (adjusted dif-
ference, 14 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 9.2 to 18.8; P<0.001), with 
no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Patients in the AID group spent 
3 hours 21 minutes more in the target range per day than those in the control group. 
No  severe  hypoglycemia  or  diabetic  ketoacidosis  occurred  in  either  group.  Two 
patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.

CONCLUSIONS
In children and adults with type 1 diabetes, the use of an open-source AID system 
resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time target glucose range 
than the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump at 24 weeks. (Supported by the

The  use  of  automated  insulin  de-

livery (AID) systems that encompass an 
insulin-delivery algorithm, insulin pump, 
and  continuous  glucose  monitoring  has  been 
shown to improve glycemic control and reduce 
the care burden for patients with type 1 diabetes.1 
A  do-it-yourself  AID  system,  called  OpenAPS,
