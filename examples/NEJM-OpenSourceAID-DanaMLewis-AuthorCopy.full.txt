BACKGROUND
Open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are used by many patients 
with type 1 diabetes. Data are needed on the efficacy and safety of an open-source 
AID system.

METHODS
In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients 
with type 1 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-
augmented insulin pump (control). The patients included both children (defined 
as 7 to 15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16 to 70 years of age). The AID 
system was a modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 
algorithm)  paired  with  a  preproduction  DANA-i  insulin  pump  and  Dexcom  G6 
CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface. The 
primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70 to 
180 mg per deciliter (3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter) between days 155 and 168 (the 
final 2 weeks of the trial).

RESULTS
A total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization (44 to 
open-source AID and 53 to the control group). At 24 weeks, the mean (±SD) time 
in the target range increased from 61.2±12.3% to 71.2±12.1% in the AID group 
and decreased from 57.7±14.3% to 54.5±16.0% in the control group (adjusted dif-
ference, 14 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 9.2 to 18.8; P<0.001), with 
no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Patients in the AID group spent 
3 hours 21 minutes more in the target range per day than those in the control group. 
No  severe  hypoglycemia  or  diabetic  ketoacidosis  occurred  in  either  group.  Two 
patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.

CONCLUSIONS
In children and adults with type 1 diabetes, the use of an open-source AID system 
resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time in the target glucose range 
than the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump at 24 weeks. (Supported by the

The  use  of  automated  insulin  de-

livery (AID) systems that encompass an 
insulin-delivery algorithm, insulin pump, 
and  continuous  glucose  monitoring  has  been 
shown to improve glycemic control and reduce 
the care burden for patients with type 1 diabetes.1 
A  do-it-yourself  AID  system,  called  OpenAPS, 
was developed by patients with diabetes and was 
shared freely as an open-source system in Febru-
ary 2015.2 Since that time, multiple open-source 
AID systems have evolved, and despite a lack of 
regulatory  approval,  such  systems  have  been 
adopted  by  approximately  2500  patients  with 
diabetes  globally.  Data  now  include  the  results 
of  more  than  55  million  hours  of  real-world 
open-source AID experience.3

Two widely used open-source AID systems are 
AndroidAPS (OpenAPS algorithm on an Android 
device)  and  Loop  (a  different  algorithm  on  an 
iOS  device).  In  a  single-group  study,  investiga-
tors  found  that  patients  who  used  the  Loop 
system had a higher percentage of time in range 
for  target  glucose  control  (70  to  180  mg  per 
deciliter [3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter]), with an 
increase in control from 67% at baseline to 73% 
at 6 months.4 However, this study was limited by 
a lack of comparative effectiveness and the en-
rollment of patients who had a high percentage 
of time in the target range at baseline.

The uptake of open-source AID systems has a 
number of barriers beyond a lack of regulatory 
approval, including a lack of trial data regarding 
safety  and  efficacy,  limited  expertise  with  the 
system among health care professionals, and a 
perception that the use of AID systems is techni-
cally  challenging.5-7  In  the  randomized,  con-
trolled trial called CREATE (Community Derived 
Automated  Insulin  Delivery),  we  evaluated  the 
efficacy and safety of an open-source AID system 
as  compared  with  sensor-augmented  insulin-
pump therapy in children and adults with type 1 
diabetes.

Methods

Trial Conduct and Oversight
The  trial  was  conducted  at  four  sites  in  New 
Zealand in compliance with Good Clinical Prac-
tice guidelines and was approved by the South-
ern  Health  and  Disability  Ethics  Committee  of 
New Zealand. The trial was funded by the Health 
Research  Council  of  New  Zealand.  Hardware 

support  was  provided  by  SOOIL  Development, 
Dexcom, and Vodafone New Zealand. The trial 
protocol (available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org) has been published previously.8 An 
independent  data  and  safety  monitoring  com-
mittee and medical monitor provided trial over-
sight. Written informed consent was provided by 
all adult patients (16 to 70 years of age) or by the 
parents or guardians of children (7 to 15 years); 
assent was also sought from all the children.

The trial was designed by representatives of 
the sponsor, the University of Otago. Data were 
collected by the investigators and site personnel, 
analyzed by a statistician employed by the spon-
sor, and interpreted by the authors. Experts on 
open-source AID systems within the trial team 
provided  training  to  clinical  staff  members.  A 
Slack workspace (Slack Technologies) facilitated 
ongoing learning by allowing clinical staff mem-
bers to communicate with each other and with 
experts in open-source AID on the trial team.9

The authors were responsible for writing the 
first draft of the manuscript or for contributing 
to the review and editing of the manuscript. All 
the  authors  made  the  decision  to  submit  the 
manuscript  for  publication  and  vouch  for  the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.

Patients and Trial Design
Eligible patients were between the ages of 7 and 
70 years, had received a diagnosis of type 1 dia-
betes at least 1 year earlier, had at least 6 months 
of  experience  with  insulin-pump  therapy,  and 
had  a  mean  glycated  hemoglobin  level  of  less 
than 10.5% (91 mmol per mole). Details regard-
ing the inclusion and exclusion criteria are pro-
vided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix,  available  at  NEJM.org.  The  ages  of  the 
patients reflected the age range in general clini-
cal practice in New Zealand.

Patients in the two trial groups (or their par-
ents or guardians) were invited to join separate 
closed online communities (Tribe Technologies) 
that provided ongoing peer support to simulate 
community  support  for  the  use  of  open-source 
AID systems. In addition, patients were instruct-
ed to contact trial staff members to discuss any 
clinical or technical issues.

During  a  4-week  run-in  phase,  patients  be-
came familiar with the trial devices functioning 
as sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy. Pa-

tients were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to the AID group or the control group with the 
use of blocks of four, six, and eight stratified 
according to age, trial site, and baseline glycated 
hemoglobin level (≤8.0% or >8.0%). A 24-week 
trial followed, with the primary end point mea-
sured between days 155 and 168 (the last 2 weeks 
of the trial) (Fig. S1). All the patients attended 
three  in-person  visits  (at  weeks  0,  12,  and  24); 
those in the AID group also had two additional 
reviews by telephone at weeks 3 and 6. During 
visits and telephone reviews, patients were asked 
about adverse events and device issues, medica-
tion use, and Dexcom alarm settings. In addition, 
staff  members  reviewed  data  using  a  unique 
URL  provided  by  Nightscout  (an  open-source 
project  that  enables  access  to  data  regarding 
continuous glucose monitoring) and advised pa-
tients  on  changes  in  device  settings.  All  the 
patients  (or  their  parents  or  guardians)  could 
alter settings between contacts, but staff mem-
bers  were  instructed  to  avoid  surveillance  out-
side  of  scheduled  reviews  and  did  not  receive 
automated alerts. This approach was designed to 
negate  an  effect  on  outcomes  caused  by  addi-
tional scheduled contact with the trial team in 
the AID group.

Open-Source AID
The system was a modified version of AndroidAPS 
2.810  (which  uses  the  standard  OpenAPS  0.7.0 
algorithm11) paired with a preproduction DANA-i 
insulin  pump  and  Dexcom  G6  CGM.  The  user 
interface was an Android smartphone application 
(AnyDANA-Loop).  Modifications  reduced  the 
number of objectives and time required to enable 
closed-loop therapy. Patients used the AnyDANA-
Loop application for mealtime insulin adminis-
tration  and  AnyDANA-Loop  automated  insulin 
delivery in response to the glucose target. Any 
changes  to  user-specific  settings  were  made 
with the patients’ involvement, according to the 
technical manual (Table S2). Written guidelines 
and  “how  to”  video  demonstrations  of  key  as-
pects of the applications were provided to all the 
patients in the AID group.

lin  doses.  The  sensor-augmented  insulin-pump 
therapy was not designed to predict low-glucose 
levels  or  to  suspend  insulin  administration.  A 
smartphone  application,  called  Monitor,  trans-
mitted data regarding continuous glucose moni-
toring to Nightscout.

Outcomes
The  primary  outcome  was  percentage  of  time 
in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg per 
deciliter (3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter) between day 
155 and day 168. Secondary outcomes were met-
rics for continuous glucose monitoring12 between 
days  155  and  168,  which  were  categorized  as 
occurring during a 24-hour period, during day-
time  hours  (6  a.m.  to  midnight),  or  during 
nighttime hours (midnight to 6 a.m.); the gly-
cated  hemoglobin  level,  as  measured  by  cali-
brated  point-of-care  instruments  (DCA  Vantage 
Analyzer, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics); and 
the  performance  of  the  AID  system  (the  time 
that the system was automating insulin delivery 
and the incidence of device deficiencies). Sepa-
rate  analyses  were  prespecified  to  evaluate  the 
psychosocial effect of device use, the collective 
learning of patients and staff members, and eat-
ing behaviors (Table S3).

Adverse  events  that  were  evaluated  included 
adverse  device  effects,  serious  adverse  events, 
and serious adverse device effects. Severe hypo-
glycemia  or  hyperglycemia  and  diabetic  keto-
acidosis were reported as serious adverse events 
or serious adverse device effects.

At approximately 3 months into the trial (af-
ter the enrollment of approximately two thirds 
of the patients), a battery problem in a prepro-
duction DANA-i insulin pump was identified. A 
device deficiency was recorded when the pump 
battery  lasted  less  than  2  weeks,  and  a  device 
deficiency with potential serious adverse device 
effects was reported when the pump turned off 
without warning. Patients in the control group 
had the option of returning to their usual insu-
lin  pump  (which  52  of  53  patients  did),  and 
those in the AID group used refurbished prepro-
duction DANA-i insulin pumps.

Sensor-Augmented Insulin-Pump Therapy
Patients in the control group used the Dexcom 
G6 CGM with high and low glucose alerts and 
their  usual  insulin  pump  or  a  preproduction 
DANA-i insulin pump to administer bolus insu-

Statistical Analysis
We  calculated  that  68  patients  (34  per  group) 
would provide 90% power with a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis of no 
between-group difference in the time in range,

assuming  a  population  standard  deviation  of 
12.5% and an absolute treatment effect of 10%.13 
The sample size was increased to 50 adults and 
50 children to allow for a differential treatment 
effect according to age, improved safety assess-
ment, and potential loss to follow-up.

Data  capture  and  management  processes 
have  been  described  previously.8  Data  cleaning 
and analyses were performed with the use of 
R  software,  version  4.1.1.  Data  regarding  con-
tinuous glucose monitoring were extracted from 
Nightscout  and  glucose  metrics  calculated  for 
sequential  14-day  periods,  starting  14  days  be-
fore the trial period began and finishing at day 
168.  Data  were  aggregated  according  to  trial 
group and time of day.

The  primary  outcome  was  fitted  to  a  linear 
regression model with independent variables in-
cluding  stratification  variables,  dependent  vari-
ables measured at baseline, trial group, and age 
according  to  group  interaction.  We  compared 
this model sequentially with simpler models (in 
which the trial group or the interaction accord-
ing to age was excluded) using analysis of vari-
ance to calculate two-sided P values for an overall 
treatment effect and differential treatment effect 
according  to  age.  Between-group  differences 
were  estimated  with  95%  confidence  intervals. 
Secondary  outcomes  regarding  continuous  glu-
cose monitoring and glycated hemoglobin were 
handled  similarly  without  hypothesis  testing. 
The widths of the confidence intervals were not 
adjusted for multiplicity and may not be used in 
place of hypothesis testing. Linear mixed-effects 
regression models that incorporated all available 
data were used to confirm the robustness of the 
results (Table S4).

Patients and Follow-up
A total of 100 patients were enrolled from Sep-
tember 2020 through May 2021. Three patients 
withdrew during the run-in period, and 97 pa-
tients  (48  children  and  49  adults)  underwent 
randomization to either the AID group (44 pa-
tients)  or  the  control  group  (53  patients).  Un-
balanced  group  size  was  exacerbated  by  the 
number  of  strata  (16)  that  were  used  during 
randomization.8

The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were  similar  in  the  two  trial  groups  (Tables  1 

and S5). Children were more likely than adults 
to  have  used  continuous  glucose  monitoring; 
previous  use  of  AID  systems  was  uncommon. 
Table  S6  shows  the  representativeness  of  the 
patients  among  the  population  of  those  with 
type 1 diabetes.

The final patient completed the trial in Novem-
ber 2021. Two patients in the AID group (1 child 
and 1 adult) withdrew from the trial because of 
frustration with the trial devices; all 53 patients 
in  the  control  group  completed  the  trial  (Fig. 
S2).  During  days  155  to  168,  the  median  per-
centage of expected readings that were recorded 
by continuous glucose monitoring was 97% (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 95 to 99) in the AID group 
and 95% (IQR, 89 to 98) in the control group. 
Eight patients (2 in the AID group and 6 in the 
control  group)  provided  less  than  70%  of  ex-
pected glucose readings.

Efficacy Outcomes
All Patients
In the primary analysis, the mean (±SD) time in 
the  target  range  increased  from  61.2±12.3%  at 
baseline  to  71.2±12.1%  in  the  AID  group  and 
decreased from 57.7±14.3% to 54.5±16.0% in the 
control  group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  14.0 
percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
9.2 to 18.8; P<0.001); the between-group differ-
ence per day was 3 hours 21 minutes. The per-
centage of patients who had a time in range of 
more than 70% and a time below range (<70 mg 
per deciliter) of less than 4% was 52.0% in the 
AID group and 11.0% in the control group (ad-
justed  difference,  36.9  percentage  points;  95% 
CI, 25.9 to 48.5). No treatment effect according 
to  interaction  by  age  was  detected  (P = 0.56). 
Primary  and  secondary  efficacy  glycemic  out-
comes are provided separately for children and 
adults  (Tables  2  and  S7).  Additional  subgroup 
analyses of the percentage of time in the target 
range are provided in Table S8.

Children
Among the children, the mean time in range 
increased  from  57.4±10.6%  at  baseline  to 
67.5±11.5%  in  the  AID  group  and  decreased 
from  55.1±12.6%  to  52.5±17.5%  in  the  control 
group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  12.6  percent-
age  points;  95%  CI,  5.7  to  19.5);  the  between-
group difference per day was 3 hours 1 minute. 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  had  a  time  in

range of more than 70% and a time below range 
of less than 4% was 40% in the AID group and 
7%  in  the  control  group  (adjusted  difference, 
32.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 16.2 to 49.7). The 
intervention effect was apparent within 2 weeks 
after the initiation of AID and was maintained 
during the 24-week trial period (Fig. 1).

During  a  24-hour  period,  the  percentage  of 
time that patients had a glucose reading of less 
than 70 mg per deciliter was 2.1% (30 minutes) 
in the AID group and 2.7% (39 minutes) in the 
control  group.  The  percentage  of  time  that 
patients  had  a  glucose  reading  of  more  than 
180 mg per deciliter was 39.1% (9 hours 24 min-
utes) in the AID group and 44.8% (10 hours 48 
minutes) in the control group.

The  use  of  AID  was  most  effective  at  night 
(Figs. 2 and S3), when the mean time in range 
was 76.8±15.8%, as compared with 64.3±11.7% 
during the day. In the control group, the mean 
time  in  range  was  57.2±21.4%  at  night  and 
50.9±17.4% during the day. Overnight, the per-
centage of time that patients had a time in range 
of less than 70 mg per deciliter was 1.2% in the 
AID group and 3.1% in the control group. At the 
end of the trial, the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 7.0% (52.6 mmol per mole) in the AID 
group  and  7.6%  (59.2  mmol  per  mole)  in  the 
control group.

Adults
Among  the  adults,  the  mean  time  in  range 
increased  from  64.7±12.9%  at  baseline  to 
74.5±11.9%  in  the  AID  group  and  decreased 
from  60.3±15.6%  to  56.5±14.2%  in  the  control 
group  (mean  adjusted  difference,  15.4  percent-
age  points;  95%  CI,  8.6  to  22.1);  the  between-
group  difference  per  day  was  3  hours  41  min-
utes. The mean percentage of patients who had 
a time in range of more than 70% and a time 
below range of less than 4% was 64% in the AID 
group  and  15%  in  the  control  group  (adjusted 
difference, 41.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 27.0 
to 57.5).

During a 24-hour period, the mean percent-
age of time that the glucose value was less than 
70 mg per deciliter was 1.6% (23 minutes) in the 
AID group and 1.8% (26 minutes) in the control 
group. The percentage of time that the glucose 
value  was  more  than  180  mg  per  deciliter  was 
23.9%  (5  hours  42  minutes)  in  the  AID  group 
and 41.6% (10.0 hours) in the control group. As 

with  the  children,  the  use  of  AID  was  most 
effective in the adults at night, when the time 
in  range  was  85.2±12.7%,  as  compared  with 
70.9±12.7% during the day. In the control group, 
the  mean  time  in  range  at  night  (53.5±20.1%) 
was similar to that during the day (57.5±14.4%) 
(Figs. 2 and S3). Overnight, the percentage of 
time that the glucose level was less than 70 mg 
per  deciliter  was  2.2%  in  the  AID  group  and 
1.9%  in  the  control  group.  In  both  adults  and 
children, the increases in the percentage of time 
in range was attributed mainly to overnight im-
provement with the AID system (Fig. S4). At the 
end of the trial, the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 6.8% (50.7 mmol per mole) in the AID 
group  and  7.5%  (58.5  mmol  per  mole)  in  the 
control group.

Safety Outcomes
Neither severe hypoglycemia nor diabetic keto-
acidosis  occurred  in  either  trial  group,  and  no 
adverse events were related to the algorithm or 
automation of insulin delivery. Prespecified ad-
verse events are provided in Table 3.

Ten adverse events that were related to a de-
vice (nonserious adverse device effects) were re-
ported among 8 patients in the AID group, and 
8 events were reported among 8 patients in the 
control group. These events included 6 hypergly-
cemia  events  in  the  AID  group  and  5  in  the 
control group and were mainly due to infusion-
set  failures.  One  adult  in  the  AID  group  had 
superficial  skin  burns  on  separate  occasions 
from two different preproduction DANA-i insu-
lin pumps.

Two  serious  adverse  events  occurred  in  the 
AID  group  (hospitalizations  for  hyperglycemia 
in one child due to infusion-set failure and the 
other  unrelated  to  diabetes),  and  5  serious  ad-
verse  events  (all  in  children)  occurred  in  the 
control group: 1 hyperglycemia event owing to 
insulin-pump failure and 4 events unrelated to 
diabetes. The rate of severe hyperglycemia and 
ketosis  (capillary  glucose  level,  >300  mg  per 
deciliter; ketones, >1.5 mmol per liter and symp-
tomatic) per 100 user-days was 0.10 in the AID 
group and 0.07 in the control group.

System Performance
In the AID group, the median percentage of time 
that the system was automating insulin delivery 
was 94.2% (IQR, 87.3 to 95.7) (Table S9). Device

§ 
¶ 

 Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Children were defined as patients under the age of 16 years. A full list of patient 
characteristics at baseline is shown in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. IQR denotes interquartile range.
 The patients (or their parents or guardians) could select more than one ethnic group. However, they were assigned 
to a single ethnic group for statistical evaluation with the list prioritized in the order of Maori; Pacific Islander; Asian; 
Middle Eastern, Latin American, or African; and European or other. No patients selected the Pacific Islander category, 
and no children selected the Middle Eastern, Latin American, or African category.
 The New Zealand Deprivation Index is an area­based measure of socioeconomic deprivation in which the fifth quintile 
represents the 20% most deprived areas in the country.
 Glycated hemoglobin was measured with the use of the DCA Vantage Analyzer.
 Previous use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was defined as use of a CGM system more than 75% of the 
time before the baseline visit.
 Automated insulin delivery refers to a hybrid closed­loop system.

‖ 
**   The time in the target glucose range is the percentage of time that the patient had a glucose level of 70 to 180 mg per 

deciliter (3.9 to 10.0 mmol per liter) during the run­in period.

deficiencies are shown in Table S10. Fewer de-
vice  deficiencies  were  reported  during  the  ran-
domized trial than during the run-in period (0.8 
per 100 user-days vs. 5.1 per 100 user-days). This 
difference reflects action taken to address the 
battery problem that has been described previ-
ously.

Most device deficiencies were related to hard-
ware (46 in the AID group and 39 in the control 
group) followed by connectivity issues (20 in the 
AID group and 7 in the control group); one de-
vice deficiency was attributed to the application 
display.  The  insulin  pump  produced  the  most 
device  deficiencies  (47  events  affecting  34  pa-
tients), followed by the pump Auto Setter device 
(16 events).

Discussion

In  the  CREATE  trial,  we  found  that  patients 
who were using the open-source AID system had 
3  hours  21  minutes  more  time  in  the  target 
glucose range per day than those who were us-
ing sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy, a 
between-group  difference  of  14  percentage 
points. Patients in the AID group had improved 

glycemic  control  while  maintaining  a  low  per-
centage of time during which the glucose level 
was less than 70 mg per deciliter. The improved 
glycemic  control  during  AID  therapy  is  consis-
tent  with  findings  in  observational  studies,14,15 
which  are  limited  by  a  self-selected  cohort  of 
patients who have chosen to use an open-source 
AID system. The positive effect of AID therapy 
on glycemia in our trial was greatest overnight, 
a finding that was consistent with the results of 
evaluations of commercial AID systems.16 In the 
AID  group,  adults  had  a  higher  percentage  of 
time in the target range than children,13,17 pos-
sibly because of differences in glycemic variabil-
ity,18 likelihood of administration of an insulin 
bolus  before  a  meal,  activity  level,  and  dietary 
factors. Even so, children still had the greatest 
improvement  in  the  percentage  of  time  in  the 
target range between baseline and the end of the 
trial.  Other  studies  have  also  shown  that  pa-
tients with the lowest baseline time in the target 
range gain the most from the use of AID.16,19

The absolute differences in the percentage of 
time in range between the trial groups are simi-
lar  to  between-group  differences  for  commer-
cially available AID systems.13,16,17 Such between-

Figure 1. Percentage of Time in Target Glucose Range, According to Age Group and Trial Period.
Box plots show the percentage of time that patients were in the target glucose range (70 to 180 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 10.0 mmol per 
 liter]) among those who were assigned to use open­source automated insulin delivery (AID group) or sensor­augmented insulin­pump 
therapy (control group). Values were measured by continuous glucose monitoring during contiguous 4­week periods from 4 weeks be­
fore randomization to 24 weeks after randomization in children (7 to 15 years of age) and adults (16 to 70 years of age). Data are pre­
sented according to the time period of measurement, with daytime defined as 6 a.m. to midnight and nighttime as midnight to 6 a.m. 
Black dots indicate group means, and horizontal bars group medians; the bottom and top of each box represent the 25th and 75th per­
centiles, respectively.

group  differences  are  partly  attributable  to  the 
decrease in the percentage of time in range in 
the control group after the run-in period, which 

we hypothesize was due to a waning awareness 
of being observed (Hawthorne effect) over time.

Figure 2. Percentage of Time in Target Glucose Range, According to Time of Day.
Envelope plots show the percentage of time that children and adults in the two trial groups were in the target glu­
cose range, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring during weeks 22 and 23 after randomization. Symbols 
represent hourly group median values, and shaded regions indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles.

performance was the main burden on patients 
in  the  AID  group.  Occlusions  in  the  insulin-
infusion set were the main cause of hyperglyce-
mia.  The  absence  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis  and 
severe hypoglycemia in the two groups was re-
assuring.

One strength of our trial is that the patients 
were  more  representative  of  those  with  type  1 
diabetes  than  the  patients  in  many  real-world 
studies.20  In  addition,  in  our  trial,  the  patients 
did not have experience with open-source AID, 
which  suggests  that  a  range  of  patients  with 
type  1  diabetes  can  benefit  from  this  system. 
The majority of patients’ contacts with trial staff 
members were for troubleshooting hardware is-
sues, and the deficiencies of the devices in the 

two groups were similar. We observed that with 
appropriate  training,  health  care  professionals 
can  provide  technical  and  clinical  support  for 
open-source AID users. The trial also had a high 
level of patient retention (98%), a lack of remote 
monitoring (which resembled real-world clinical 
practice),  and  broad  inclusion  criteria,  which 
resulted in a population of diverse ages and eth-
nic  backgrounds.  Furthermore,  the  6-month 
trial duration was suitably long to capture rare 
adverse events.

Our  trial  also  has  certain  limitations.  Real-
world support may differ from that provided in 
a trial. The control group did not have an auto-
mated  system  for  predicting  low-glucose  levels 
or  suspending  insulin  administration,  features

*  No cases of severe hypoglycemia (defined as a low blood glucose level causing altered mental consciousness and in­

ability to assist in care) or diabetic ketoacidosis (defined as a blood glucose level of >250 mg per deciliter [>13.9 mmol 
per liter], an arterial pH of <7.3 or a venous pH of <15 mEq per liter, or moderate ketonuria or ketonemia leading to 
hospitalization) were reported in either group.

†  A nonserious adverse device effect was defined as any untoward medical occurrence related to the use of an investiga­

tional device.

‡  A serious adverse event was defined as an adverse event that was unrelated to the use of a device and that was life­

threatening, caused permanent impairment to a body structure or function, required hospitalization, or led to a medi­
cal or surgical intervention to curb serious sequelae. A serious adverse device effect was defined as a serious adverse 
event that was related to the use of an investigational device.

§  There were no serious adverse events or serious adverse device effects in the adult cohort.

that have been shown to reduce the incidence of 
hypoglycemia.21 The generalizability of our find-
ings  may  be  limited  by  the  enrollment  of  pa-
tients with a relatively low glycated hemoglobin 
level at baseline, by the underrepresentation of 
patients with reduced economic resources, and 
by  the  increased  familiarity  with  insulin-pump 
therapy and continuous glucose monitoring among 
the  patients  at  baseline.  However,  the  trial  pa-
tients were more diverse than those enrolled in 
previous  studies  that  had  been  biased  by  pa-
tients’ selection of open-source AID. The effect size 
is  partially  due  to  a  small  decline  in  the  per-

centage of time in the target range in the con-
trol group, which has not been observed in other 
studies.  Unscheduled  contacts  with  trial  staff 
members  by  telephone,  email,  or  text  message 
were not recorded. Measurement of glycated hemo-
globin was not centralized and was performed on 
a point-of-care basis. Patients in the two groups 
used  different  insulin  pumps,  although  other 
studies have compared AID with “usual care.”22,23 
In addition, a variety of insulin pumps were used 
in the control group, although the stable time in 
the  target  range  throughout  the  trial  suggests 
that this factor had a minimal effect.

Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 Diabetes

In children and adults with type 1 diabetes, 
the use of an open-source AID system resulted 
in a significantly higher percentage of time in the 
target  glucose  range  than  the  use  of  a  sensor-
augmented insulin pump at 24 weeks.
