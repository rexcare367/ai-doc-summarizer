Making sure that the development of artificial intelligence (AI) goes well is a crucial question for humanity. Currently, resources dedicated to AI are mostly focused on speeding up its development, while efforts to increase its safety are under-resourced. This neglect of AI safety work means that individuals have a good chance to make a positive difference if they dedicate themselves to this problem. However, it needs more than individual efforts; society needs to become knowledgeable about the technology and understand what is at stake. Our World in Data is doing its part to enable a better informed public conversation on AI and the future we want to live in.
