This section discusses two widely used open-source AID systems, AndroidAPS and Loop, and the barriers to their uptake. It also introduces the CREATE (Community Derived Automated Insulin Delivery) trial, which was conducted at four sites in New Zealand to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an open-source AID system compared to sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy in children and adults with type 1 diabetes. The trial was approved by the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee of New Zealand and funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. Hardware support was provided by SOOIL Development, Dexcom, and Vodafone New Zealand. The trial protocol has been published previously and an independent data and safety monitoring committee and medical monitor provided trial oversight. Eligible patients were between the ages of 7 and 70 years, had received a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at least 1 year earlier, had at least 6 months of experience with insulin-pump therapy, and had a mean glycated hemoglobin level of less than 10.5%. Patients in the two trial groups were invited to join separate closed online communities that provided ongoing peer support.
