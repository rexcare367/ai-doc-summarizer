This section discusses the difference between human-level AI and transformative AI, and the potential timeline for when either of these levels of AI might be achieved. It is noted that transformative AI could be developed before human-level AI, and that the timeline for when either of these levels of AI might be achieved is difficult to predict. The article provides a link to a companion article which gives an overview of what researchers in this field currently believe about the timeline for AI development.
