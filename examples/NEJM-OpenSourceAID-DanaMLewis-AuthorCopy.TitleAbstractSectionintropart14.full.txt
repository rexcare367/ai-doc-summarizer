Figure 1. Percentage of Time in Target Glucose Range, According to Age Group and Trial Period.
Box plots show the percentage of time that patients were in the target glucose range (70 to 180 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 10.0 mmol per 
 liter]) among those who were assigned to use open­source automated insulin delivery (AID group) or sensor­augmented insulin­pump 
therapy (control group). Values were measured by continuous glucose monitoring during contiguous 4­week periods from 4 weeks be­
fore randomization to 24 weeks after randomization in children (7 to 15 years of age) and adults (16 to 70 years of age). Data are pre­
sented according to the time period of measurement, with daytime defined as 6 a.m. to midnight and nighttime as midnight to 6 a.m. 
Black dots indicate group means, and horizontal bars group medians; the bottom and top of each box represent the 25th and 75th per­
centiles, respectively.

group  differences  are  partly  attributable  to  the 
decrease in the percentage of time in range in 
the control group after the run-in period, which 

we hypothesize was due to a waning awareness 
of being observed (Hawthorne effect) over time.

Figure 2. Percentage of Time in Target Glucose Range, According to Time of Day.
Envelope plots show the percentage of time that children and adults in the two trial groups were in the target glu­
cose range, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring during weeks 22 and 23 after randomization. Symbols 
represent hourly group median values, and shaded regions indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles.

performance was the main burden on patients 
in  the  AID  group.  Occlusions  in  the  insulin-
infusion set were the main cause of hyperglyce-
mia.  The  absence  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis  and 
severe hypoglycemia in the two groups was re-
assuring.

One strength of our trial is that the patients 
were  more  representative  of  those  with  type  1 
diabetes  than  the  patients  in  many  real-world 
studies.20  In  addition,  in  our  trial,  the  patients 
did not have experience with open-source AID, 
which  suggests  that  a  range  of  patients  with 
type  1  diabetes  can  benefit  from  this  system. 
The majority of patients’ contacts with trial staff 
members were for troubleshooting hardware is-
sues, and the deficiencies of the devices in the 

two groups were similar. We observed that with 
appropriate  training,  health  care  professionals 
can  provide  technical  and  clinical  support  for 
open-source AID users. The trial also had a high 
level of patient retention (98%), a lack of remote 
monitoring (which resembled real-world clinical 
practice),  and  broad  inclusion  criteria,  which 
resulted in a population of diverse ages and eth-
nic  backgrounds.  Furthermore,  the  6-month 
trial duration was suitably long to capture rare
